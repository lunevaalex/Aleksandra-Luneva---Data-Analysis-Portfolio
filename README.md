# Alexandra Luneva - Data Analysis Portfolio

About

Hi, I'm Alex! I have background and hold a Master's degree in project management in Asia-Pacific Region. Projects I've managed relate to engineering, manufacturing, logistics and equipment supplies. After 5 years working in the field and building different types of reports I've decided to develop my talents in a field of analytics and creating impact through data.

I've made this repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics.
